\section*{Comments}

Sam did not contribute much to the work in this deliverable, despite repeated requests to take up 
work. He did apologise for this lack of work a few days before the deadline, but at that point most 
of the necessary work had been done, and he was slow to complete the tasks he was given at that 
point.
